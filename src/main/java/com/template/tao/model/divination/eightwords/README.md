## Part 2: Using Ba Zi in Object instantiation 

### Motivation

- One of the harder part of world building is procedural generation
    - Especially on how to start
    - Link to first article
- Enter Ba Zi

### Ba Zi: The multilayer analysis

#### The metrics
- 5 element (main) & 2 energy (supplementary) (ref: I Ching 2 Form)
- everything will be associated with these
- Ba Zi is basically element analysis of one's chart
- What is everything?:
    - basic: heavenly stem, earthly branch -> birth chart
    - advanced: 10 year chart, hidden heavenly stem, ten god, etc
        - to be researched
        - basically analysis can be as complex as one want
    - in ecosystem: anything Taoists can think of is assign to an element
  e.g. music note, sense, flavour, organ, season etc

#### The chart
- Calculate 4 pillars
    - input: year, month, date, hour of birth; gender (for luck pillar) 
        - note: name is interesting, in practice person's name is decided based on this birth chart, 
      to achieve elemental balance; then account for in more advance analysis of later chart 
      e.g. Zi Wei Dou Shu (. need more citation to confirm)
    - each pillar follow their sexagenary cycle (nested cycles)
    - calculate stem and branch, as well as associated elements

#### The result
- As said, multilayer analysis, including (non-exhaustive)
    - day stem represent self element
    - can calculate elemental strength/weakness
    - evaluate lifetime luck, encounter
- Thus, is a good framework for object information (character/loot)
    - interoperability: simple concept of adding element to object and include in analysis 
- However, this system is somewhat opinionated
    - the system is balanced by default, individual working to achieve balance
        - not suitable if one want a system imbalance by default (individuality)
- Note (POV): I Ching is about the world/surrounding while Ba Zi is about character/self
